'''
Usage: python GenerateInput.py file_path.mtx
Output goes to: file_path.in

Converts matrix market files to directed graphs of the following format:

1. The first line has N, the number of vertices.
2. Each of the following N lines have the vertices that are connected to that vertex. If there are none, the line is empty.

In other words:

N
vertices that vertex 1 has outgoing edges towards
vertices that vertex 2 has outgoing edges towards
...
vertices that vertex N has outgoing edges towards
